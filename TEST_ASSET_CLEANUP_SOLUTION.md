# Test Asset Cleanup Solution

This document describes the complete solution for finding and cleaning "Test Distribution Asset" entries for repeatable testing in the AMP system.

## Problem

The test environment had many "Test Distribution Asset" entries with existing distributions and assignments that prevented repeatable testing. When running `test_end_to_end_distribution_workflow`, tests would fail because assets had leftover state from previous test runs.

## Solution Overview

I created a comprehensive workflow with three new examples that work together to:

1. **Find** test assets that need cleanup
2. **Clean** specific assets by removing distributions and assignments  
3. **Verify** the cleanup was successful and provide guidance

## New Examples Created

### 1. `find_test_distribution_assets.rs`

**Purpose**: Scans all assets to find "Test Distribution Asset" entries that have distributions or assignments needing cleanup.

**Usage**:
```bash
cargo run --example find_test_distribution_assets
```

**What it does**:
- Lists all assets with "Test Distribution Asset" in the name
- Analyzes each asset for:
  - Number of assignments (active/inactive)
  - Number of distributions (confirmed/unconfirmed)
  - Cleanup requirements
- Provides specific recommendations for which assets to clean

**Sample Output**:
```
‚úÖ Found 36 test assets that need cleanup:

üßπ ASSETS NEEDING CLEANUP:
   ‚Ä¢ Test Distribution Asset 1760731407 (93cffcb9-c1f5-4873-b5dc-f3ba1f29e3c2)
     - Unconfirmed distributions: 0
     - Active assignments: 1

üöÄ CLEANUP RECOMMENDATION:
üßπ Clean asset: Test Distribution Asset 1760731407 (93cffcb9-c1f5-4873-b5dc-f3ba1f29e3c2)
   - Unconfirmed distributions: 0
   - Active assignments: 1

üìã Steps to clean:
   1. Edit examples/cancel_test_asset_distribution.rs
   2. Change asset_uuid to: 93cffcb9-c1f5-4873-b5dc-f3ba1f29e3c2
   3. Run: cargo run --example cancel_test_asset_distribution
   4. After cleanup, use this asset for testing
```

### 2. Enhanced `cancel_test_asset_distribution.rs`

**Purpose**: Cleans a specific test asset by cancelling distributions and deleting assignments.

**Usage**:
1. Edit the `asset_uuid` variable in the file
2. Run: `cargo run --example cancel_test_asset_distribution`

**What it does**:
- Cancels all unconfirmed distributions
- Deletes all assignments (distributed and undistributed)
- Verifies cleanup was successful
- Provides UTXO analysis to diagnose availability issues

**Sample Output**:
```
üéØ Targeting test asset: 93cffcb9-c1f5-4873-b5dc-f3ba1f29e3c2

üóëÔ∏è  Cancelling distributions...
  Cancelling 519a4d03-71bf-4c00-84f2-637e8196e2d6... ‚úÖ Success

üóëÔ∏è  Deleting assignments...
  Deleting assignment 1743... ‚úÖ Success

üìà Summary:
  ‚úÖ Distributions cancelled: 1
  ‚úÖ Assignments deleted: 1
  üìä Total operations: 2

üéâ Cleanup verified successful!
   The test asset is completely clean and available for new distributions.
```

### 3. `test_asset_cleanup_workflow.rs`

**Purpose**: Verifies cleanup results and provides comprehensive guidance for repeatable testing.

**Usage**:
```bash
cargo run --example test_asset_cleanup_workflow
```

**What it does**:
- Verifies the cleaned asset has no remaining distributions or assignments
- Provides detailed guidance on UTXO issues and solutions
- Documents the complete workflow for future use
- Gives specific asset details for testing

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Find Assets Needing Cleanup
```bash
cargo run --example find_test_distribution_assets
```

This will show you all test assets that have distributions or assignments to clean up.

### Step 2: Clean a Specific Asset
1. Copy the asset UUID from step 1
2. Edit `examples/cancel_test_asset_distribution.rs`:
   ```rust
   let asset_uuid = "93cffcb9-c1f5-4873-b5dc-f3ba1f29e3c2"; // Replace with your UUID
   ```
3. Run the cleanup:
   ```bash
   cargo run --example cancel_test_asset_distribution
   ```

### Step 3: Verify and Get Guidance
```bash
cargo run --example test_asset_cleanup_workflow
```

This confirms the asset is clean and provides next steps.

## Results Achieved

### Successfully Cleaned Asset
- **UUID**: `93cffcb9-c1f5-4873-b5dc-f3ba1f29e3c2`
- **Name**: Test Distribution Asset 1760731407
- **Asset ID**: `a5b89f0431810db70fb35554b7e46977e50c5b3633113b09caa82f61e6175c58`
- **Ticker**: TDA1407
- **Status**: Completely clean (0 distributions, 0 assignments)

### Cleanup Statistics
- **Distributions cancelled**: 1
- **Assignments deleted**: 1
- **Verification**: Confirmed clean state

## UTXO Issue Identified

The cleaned asset currently has **no UTXOs available**, which is why distributions fail with "No spendable UTXOs found". This is a separate issue from the cleanup.

### UTXO Solutions
1. **Import Treasury Address**: Ensure the treasury address is imported as watch-only in the Elements node
2. **Check Issuance**: Verify the asset issuance transaction is confirmed  
3. **Sync Elements Node**: Ensure the Elements node is fully synced
4. **Check Asset Registration**: Verify the asset is properly registered in AMP

## Usage for Repeatable Testing

Once the UTXO issue is resolved, the cleaned asset can be used for:

- `test_end_to_end_distribution_workflow`
- Any distribution tests requiring a clean asset
- Repeatable test scenarios

### For Future Cleanup

When tests leave assets in a dirty state, simply:

1. Run `find_test_distribution_assets` to identify dirty assets
2. Pick an asset UUID and update `cancel_test_asset_distribution.rs`
3. Run the cleanup
4. Verify with `test_asset_cleanup_workflow`

## Key Benefits

1. **Repeatable Testing**: Assets can be cleaned and reused
2. **Automated Discovery**: No manual searching for dirty assets
3. **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Handles both distributions and assignments
4. **Verification**: Confirms cleanup success
5. **Diagnostic Information**: Identifies UTXO and other issues
6. **Future-Proof**: Workflow can be repeated as needed

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `examples/find_test_distribution_assets.rs`
- `examples/test_asset_cleanup_workflow.rs`
- `TEST_ASSET_CLEANUP_SOLUTION.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- `examples/cancel_test_asset_distribution.rs` (enhanced with better cleanup logic and UTXO analysis)

This solution provides a complete, automated workflow for maintaining clean test assets for repeatable testing in the AMP system.
