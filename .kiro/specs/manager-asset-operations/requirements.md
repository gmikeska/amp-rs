# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds three new methods to the AMP client library to support manager operations and asset assignment functionality. The methods will provide capabilities for locking managers, adding assets to managers, and retrieving asset assignment details. Each method will follow the existing patterns in the codebase with proper error handling, authentication, and comprehensive testing including both mocked and live tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want to lock a specific manager, so that I can prevent further operations on that manager when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the lock_manager method with a valid manager ID THEN the system SHALL send a PUT request to "/api/managers/{managerId}/lock"
2. WHEN the lock operation is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response
3. WHEN the manager ID is invalid or the operation fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL create a test manager, perform the lock operation, and clean up by deleting the manager afterward

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want to authorize a manager to manage a specific asset, so that I can establish proper asset management relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the add_asset_to_manager method with valid manager ID and asset UUID THEN the system SHALL send a PUT request to "/api/managers/{managerId}/assets/{assetUuid}/add"
2. WHEN the authorization is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response
3. WHEN the manager ID or asset UUID is invalid or the operation fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL create a test manager, perform the asset authorization, and clean up by deleting the manager afterward

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want to retrieve details for a specific asset assignment, so that I can access assignment information for reporting and management purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the get_asset_assignment method with valid asset UUID and assignment ID THEN the system SHALL send a GET request to "/api/assets/{assetUuid}/assignments/{assignmentId}"
2. WHEN the assignment exists THEN the system SHALL return the assignment details
3. WHEN the asset UUID or assignment ID is invalid or the assignment doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use the create_asset_assignment workflow to set up test data, retrieve the assignment, and use the create_asset_assignment cleanup to clean up afterward

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the AMP client library, I want comprehensive test coverage for all new methods, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing each new method THEN the system SHALL include both mocked tests and live tests
2. WHEN running mocked tests THEN the system SHALL use httpmock to simulate API responses without external dependencies
3. WHEN running live tests THEN the system SHALL interact with the actual AMP API using environment variables for authentication
4. WHEN tests involve state changes THEN the system SHALL mark them with #[ignore] attribute for selective execution
5. WHEN tests create resources THEN the system SHALL clean up those resources after test completion to maintain test isolation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want all new methods to follow existing patterns, so that the API remains consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new methods THEN the system SHALL use async/await patterns consistent with existing methods
2. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use the existing Error enum and return Result<T, Error>
3. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL use the existing authentication and request patterns
4. WHEN defining request/response structures THEN the system SHALL place them in the model module with appropriate serde derives
5. WHEN documenting methods THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive doc comments with examples
