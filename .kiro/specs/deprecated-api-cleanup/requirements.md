# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing deprecated API functionality from the AMP Rust client library. The deprecated functionality includes asset groups, asset permissions, and audit-related endpoints and models. This cleanup will eliminate unused code while ensuring the remaining functionality (categories, registered users, managers, assets, etc.) continues to work correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want deprecated asset group functionality removed so that the codebase is cleaner and only contains supported API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any AssetGroup, CreateAssetGroup, UpdateAssetGroup, or AddAssetToGroup models
2. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any asset group related client methods (list_asset_groups, create_asset_group, get_asset_group, update_asset_group, delete_asset_group, add_asset_to_group)
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any asset group related mock functions
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any asset group related tests
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the project SHALL compile successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want deprecated asset permission functionality removed so that the codebase only contains supported API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any AssetPermission, CreateAssetPermission, or UpdateAssetPermission models
2. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any asset permission related client methods (list_asset_permissions, create_asset_permission, get_asset_permission, update_asset_permission, delete_asset_permission)
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any asset permission related mock functions
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any asset permission related tests
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN any asset_group fields in remaining models SHALL be removed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want deprecated audit functionality removed so that the codebase only contains supported API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any Audit, CreateAudit, or UpdateAudit models
2. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any audit related client methods (list_audits, create_audit, get_audit, update_audit, delete_audit)
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any audit related mock functions
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any audit related tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want the remaining functionality to continue working correctly after the deprecated code is removed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN all remaining functionality (categories, registered_users, managers, assets) SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN there SHALL be approximately 10 test failures for the remaining functionality that can be addressed after deprecated code removal
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN no tests SHALL exist for the removed deprecated functionality
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the README examples SHALL be updated to remove references to deprecated functionality
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN all import statements SHALL be updated to remove references to deprecated models

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the product documentation updated to reflect the removal of deprecated functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the product.md steering file SHALL be updated to remove references to asset groups, asset permissions, and audit functionality
2. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN any remaining documentation SHALL accurately reflect the available API endpoints
