# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses code quality improvements identified by running `cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic -W clippy::nursery -W rust-2018-idioms`. The goal is to fix all clippy warnings and errors to improve code maintainability, readability, and adherence to Rust best practices while ensuring all tests continue to pass.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to pass all clippy linting checks, so that the code follows Rust best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic -W clippy::nursery -W rust-2018-idioms` THEN the system SHALL complete without any errors or warnings
2. WHEN running `cargo test` THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
3. WHEN running `cargo build` THEN the system SHALL compile successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want numeric literals to be properly formatted with separators, so that large numbers are more readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering numeric literals with 5 or more digits THEN the system SHALL use underscores as thousand separators
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all numeric literals SHALL be easily readable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want functions with high cognitive complexity to be refactored, so that the code is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing function complexity THEN no function SHALL exceed the cognitive complexity threshold of 25
2. WHEN refactoring complex functions THEN the original functionality SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN splitting complex functions THEN the resulting code SHALL be more readable and maintainable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want format strings to use inline arguments, so that the code is more concise and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using format! macros THEN variables SHALL be inlined directly in the format string where possible
2. WHEN reviewing format strings THEN they SHALL follow modern Rust formatting conventions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation to properly format code identifiers, so that API documentation is clear and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing documentation comments THEN code identifiers SHALL be wrapped in backticks
2. WHEN generating documentation THEN all type names, function names, and code elements SHALL be properly formatted

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use `Self` instead of explicit type names where appropriate, so that the code is more maintainable and follows Rust conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN referencing the current type in implementations THEN `Self` SHALL be used instead of the explicit type name where applicable
2. WHEN refactoring type names THEN using `Self` SHALL make the code more maintainable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want functions returning `Result` to have proper error documentation, so that API users understand when and why functions might fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a public function returns a `Result` type THEN it SHALL include an `# Errors` section in its documentation
2. WHEN reviewing API documentation THEN error conditions SHALL be clearly documented

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant clones, so that the code is more efficient and follows Rust ownership principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN values are cloned unnecessarily THEN the clone SHALL be removed
2. WHEN optimizing code THEN ownership patterns SHALL be used efficiently

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want functions that could benefit from `#[must_use]` to be properly annotated, so that important return values are not accidentally ignored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function returns a value that should typically be used THEN it SHALL be annotated with `#[must_use]`
2. WHEN calling must-use functions THEN the compiler SHALL warn if the return value is ignored

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use character patterns instead of single-character strings, so that string operations are more efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using single-character string patterns THEN character literals SHALL be used instead
2. WHEN performing string operations THEN the most efficient pattern type SHALL be used

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant closures, so that the code is more concise and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN closures simply call a method THEN the method reference SHALL be used directly
2. WHEN optimizing code THEN unnecessary closure overhead SHALL be eliminated

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unnecessary `async` keywords, so that the code accurately reflects its asynchronous nature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function is marked `async` but contains no await statements THEN the `async` keyword SHALL be removed
2. WHEN reviewing function signatures THEN they SHALL accurately reflect whether the function is asynchronous
