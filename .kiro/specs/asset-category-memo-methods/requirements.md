# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds four new methods to the AMP client library to support asset category management and memo operations. The methods will enable adding/removing assets to/from categories and setting/retrieving asset memos, following the existing patterns in the codebase for API interactions, error handling, and testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want to add assets to categories, so that I can organize and categorize assets for better management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `add_asset_to_category` with a category ID and an asset UUID THEN the system SHALL send a PUT request to `/api/categories/{categoryId}/assets/{assetUuid}/add`
2. WHEN the request is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response
3. WHEN the request fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error with context
4. WHEN I provide invalid category ID or asset UUID THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want to remove assets from categories, so that I can update asset categorization when requirements change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `remove_asset_from_category` with a category ID and an asset UUID THEN the system SHALL send a PUT request to `/api/categories/{categoryId}/assets/{assetUuid}/remove`
2. WHEN the request is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response
3. WHEN the request fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error with context
4. WHEN I provide a category ID and asset UUID that are not associated THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want to retrieve asset memos, so that I can access descriptive information stored with assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `get_asset_memo` with an asset UUID THEN the system SHALL send a GET request to `/api/assets/{assetUuid}/memo`
2. WHEN the asset has a memo THEN the system SHALL return the memo string
3. WHEN the asset has no memo THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate response
4. WHEN the asset UUID is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want to set asset memos, so that I can store descriptive information with assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `set_asset_memo` with an asset UUID and memo string THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/api/assets/{assetUuid}/memo/set`
2. WHEN the request is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response
3. WHEN the request fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error with context
4. WHEN I provide an empty memo string THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the AMP client library, I want comprehensive test coverage for the new methods, so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new methods THEN the system SHALL include both mock and live tests for each method
2. WHEN running mock tests THEN the system SHALL use httpmock to simulate API responses without external dependencies
3. WHEN running live tests THEN the system SHALL interact with the actual AMP API using valid credentials
4. WHEN testing category methods THEN the system SHALL create and clean up test categories and assets, removing assets from categories before deletion
5. WHEN testing memo methods THEN the system SHALL use existing assets from the test environment
6. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up any created resources to prevent test pollution

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want the new methods to follow existing patterns, so that the API remains consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new methods THEN the system SHALL follow the same error handling patterns as existing methods
2. WHEN implementing the new methods THEN the system SHALL use the same authentication and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN implementing the new methods THEN the system SHALL follow the same naming conventions and code style
4. WHEN implementing the new methods THEN the system SHALL include appropriate documentation and examples
