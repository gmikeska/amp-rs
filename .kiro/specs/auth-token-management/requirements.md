# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a robust authentication token management system for the AMP API client. The system will handle automatic token lifecycle management including proactive refresh, secure storage, and graceful error handling to ensure continuous authentication without service interruption.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the AMP client library, I want automatic token management so that I don't have to manually handle token expiration and renewal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client library is initialized THEN the system SHALL provide thread-safe token storage using Arc<Mutex<Option<T>>> pattern
2. WHEN the token storage is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure the Arc<Mutex> implementation is serializable for persistence between test runs
3. WHEN a token is obtained THEN the system SHALL set the token expiry to 24 hours from the current time
4. WHEN any API call is made THEN the system SHALL automatically check token validity before making the request
5. WHEN no token exists THEN the system SHALL automatically obtain a new token using environment credentials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proactive token refresh so that my API calls never fail due to expired tokens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking token validity THEN the system SHALL refresh the token IF it expires within 5 minutes
2. WHEN refreshing a token THEN the system SHALL use the existing token to call the refresh endpoint
3. WHEN the existing token is already expired THEN the system SHALL obtain a new token instead of attempting refresh
4. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to obtaining a new token with credentials

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure credential handling so that sensitive authentication data is protected in memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL use the secrecy crate to protect sensitive data
2. WHEN credentials are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL use zeroize to clear sensitive data from memory
3. WHEN reading environment variables THEN the system SHALL wrap sensitive values in Secret types
4. WHEN logging or debugging THEN the system SHALL NOT expose actual credential values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling so that authentication failures are handled gracefully with appropriate retry logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN receiving 429 (Too Many Requests) responses THEN the system SHALL respect rate limiting with appropriate delays
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry up to a configurable maximum number of attempts
4. WHEN all retry attempts are exhausted THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error with the failure reason

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable retry behavior so that I can tune the system for different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring retry behavior THEN the system SHALL read configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN no environment configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults (3 attempts, 1000ms base delay, 30000ms max delay)
3. WHEN running in test environments THEN the system SHALL use optimized settings (2 attempts, 500ms base delay)
4. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL enforce a configurable timeout to prevent hanging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want token management utilities so that I can monitor, debug, and test token behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging token issues THEN the system SHALL provide a method to retrieve current token and expiry information
2. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL provide a method to clear stored tokens
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into token status and expiry times
4. WHEN tokens are refreshed or obtained THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the token management to integrate seamlessly with the existing API client so that all endpoints automatically benefit from robust authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making any API call THEN the system SHALL automatically include valid authentication headers
2. WHEN the API client is used THEN token management SHALL be transparent to the caller
3. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle token access safely without race conditions
4. WHEN the client is used across different threads THEN token management SHALL remain thread-safe and consistent
