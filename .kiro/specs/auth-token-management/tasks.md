# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up enhanced token data structures and serialization
  - Create `TokenData` struct with `Secret<String>` token field and timestamp tracking
  - Implement custom serde serialization for `Secret<String>` to support persistence between test runs
  - Add `TokenInfo` struct for debugging and monitoring purposes

  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.3, 6.3_

- [x] 2. Implement retry configuration system
  - Create `RetryConfig` struct with environment variable support
  - Implement `from_env()` method with default values (3 attempts, 1000ms base delay, 30000ms max delay)
  - Add `for_tests()` method with optimized settings (2 attempts, 500ms base delay)
  - Write unit tests for configuration loading and validation
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 3. Create enhanced error types for token management
  - Extend existing `Error` enum with token-specific error variants
  - Add `TokenError` enum for detailed token operation failures
  - Implement error conversion and display traits
  - Write unit tests for error creation and formatting
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 6.3_

- [x] 4. Implement retry client with exponential backoff
  - Create `RetryClient` struct wrapping reqwest::Client
  - Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retry delays
  - Add special handling for 429 (Too Many Requests) responses with rate limiting respect
  - Implement configurable request timeout enforcement
  - Write unit tests for retry logic and timeout behavior
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.4_

- [x] 5. Build core token manager with proactive refresh
  - Create `TokenManager` struct with Arc<Mutex<Option<TokenData>>> storage
  - Implement `get_token()` method with 5-minute proactive refresh logic
  - Add `obtain_token()` method using environment credentials with retry logic
  - Implement `refresh_token()` method with fallback to obtain on failure
  - Write unit tests for token lifecycle management and refresh timing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 6. Add token management utilities and debugging support
  - Implement `get_token_info()` method returning current token status and expiry information
  - Add `clear_token()` method for testing scenarios
  - Implement `force_refresh()` method for manual token refresh
  - Add comprehensive logging for token operations with secure credential handling
  - Write unit tests for utility methods and logging behavior
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Integrate token manager with existing ApiClient
  - Replace static token storage with TokenManager instance in ApiClient
  - Update `get_token()` method to use TokenManager with automatic token management
  - Ensure all API methods automatically benefit from enhanced authentication
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing public API
  - Write integration tests for seamless API client operation
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [x] 8. Implement thread safety and concurrent access handling
  - Ensure TokenManager handles multiple concurrent requests safely without race conditions
  - Add atomic token update operations to prevent partial state corruption
  - Implement proper mutex usage with minimal lock contention
  - Write concurrency tests with multiple threads accessing tokens simultaneously
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 7.3, 7.4_

- [x] 9. Add comprehensive test suite for token management
  - Create mock server tests for token obtain and refresh endpoints
  - Implement rate limiting simulation tests (429 response handling)
  - Add network failure simulation and retry behavior tests
  - Create serialization/deserialization tests for persistence between test runs
  - Write end-to-end integration tests with real API endpoints (when AMP_TESTS=live)
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.3_

- [x] 10. Update dependencies and configuration
  - Add any missing dependencies to Cargo.toml for enhanced token management
  - Update environment variable documentation with new retry configuration options
  - Ensure all security-related dependencies (secrecy, zeroize) are properly configured
  - Write configuration validation tests
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2_
